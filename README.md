# Research-Proposal
This is my Research Proposal for my UCA Honors Capstone

To download the repository on your own device:
    Click the "<> Code" button next to the "About" section.
    Download the ZIP file for the easiest access to the code files.
    Unzip that folder and make sure all the files are in the same folder.
    At this point, you have access to all of the code files for my proposal, but seeing the code structure can still be difficult.
    To see the code structure, open the folder in any text editor that you may prefer.
    I developed this in VS Code and will provide the instructions on opening it there.


Opening the proposal in VS Code:
    After the Code files are unziped, you want to make sure you have the VSCode application installed (It should have a blue logo).
    Once its installed, open it up. If you've never used it before, feel free to play around in it as VS Code is a very cool text editor.
    Navigate to the "extensions" tab on the left bar on your screen (it should be the four squares symbol).
    Download, install, and activate the C/C++ and C/C++ Extension Pack.
    Now navigate to the "file" tab at the top of your window.
    Select "Open Folder" and navigate to the unzipped folder containing my research proposal and select "open".
    You should now be able to view the file structure of my proposal on the left side of your screen and if you open a file, it should color code the syntax.

Now you are able to view my proposal as it was designed to be viewed.
