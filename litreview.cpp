        Chicken works with an interpreter reading a chicken file to translate
        chicken code into proper computer instruction. The way it defines what instructions
        to run is by pre-defined operation codes. The interpreter counts how many
        chickens are in each line, and that number corresponds to different operational
        codes that can easily get turned into assembly language code that a computer can
        understand very easily.

        The Chef esolang manages to disguise a coding language as

        computer instructions. This code is more complex than chicken -- 
        which makes sense since a recipie is more complex
        than a single word. While this esolang is interesting, the main

        Not words, not sentences, characters. The way Brianfuck works is by moving a pointer
        arround an array of memory. Symbols either move the pointer, or change the value of 
        the memory address the pointer is pointing to. Even though this is a very simplistic
        idea and implementation of code, it is considered Turing-complete.

        in his paper that given infinite time and infinite memory, a turing machine can
        solve any computational problem. That conjecture is the basis of turing completeness.
        With how computer languages work nowadays, they can be very similar to turing machines
        even though they only work within computers. A coding language is said to be
        turing complete if it is able to solve any computational problem given infinite
        time and infinite memory.

        easier than a compiler does since errors happen and get executed on the exact line
        that was being read at that moment. An interpreter also doesn't create a seperate
        code file since the program is running during the translation. This makes each consecutive
